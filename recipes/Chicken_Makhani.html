    <h1>Chicken_Makhani</h1>
    <h3>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</h3>
    <p>Chicken Makhani, also known as Indian Butter Chicken, is a rich and creamy curry dish that originated in Northern India. To make it, chicken is first marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices like cumin, coriander, chili powder, and ginger-garlic paste. The marinated chicken is then grilled or pan-fried until cooked through. In a separate pan, onions are sautéed until softened, then tomatoes, tomato puree, and more spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves are added. This flavorful sauce is simmered until thickened, then heavy cream or butter is stirred in to create the signature creamy, velvety texture. The cooked chicken is added to the sauce and simmered briefly to allow the flavors to meld. Garnishes like chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice are added just before serving the Chicken Makhani with basmati rice or naan bread.</p>
