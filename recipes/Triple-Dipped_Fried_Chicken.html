    <h3>This fried chicken batter yields the crispiest, spiciest, homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted! It has been a picnic favorite in my family for years and tastes equally good served hot or cold.</h3>
    <p>To make triple-dipped fried chicken, you first coat chicken pieces in seasoned flour, then dip them in beaten eggs, and finally coat them in seasoned breadcrumbs before frying them in hot oil until golden brown and crispy. The triple-dipping process creates an extra thick and crunchy breading that seals in the juices of the chicken, resulting in a flavorful and satisfying fried chicken dish. The combination of the seasoned flour, egg wash, and breadcrumb coatings gives the chicken a delicious, multi-textured exterior that contrasts perfectly with the tender, juicy meat inside.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
    <li> quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    <li> ½ tablespoons garlic salt</li>
    <li> tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li> tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
    <li> ½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
    <li> teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li> (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.</li>
        <li>Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.</li>
        <li>Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Enjoy!</li>
